#ï»¿ Stock Price Predictor
we have done a comparative analysis between different models of Deep Learning and Machine learning and try to estimate the close price of a stock. Under Machine Learning we used Regression models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees and in Deep Learning we used two-layer LSTM Model. Under Regression we received the accuracy and RMSE Score of 99.14% & 0.998, 99.32% & 0.999, 99.37% & 0.999 respectively for Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Treesand for LSTM we received an accuracy and RMSE score as 98.53% & 3.334.
